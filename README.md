Writing notes -web project.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch dropdown menu in GitHub to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at each stage of the video, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.
  

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
